# owZ' Manifests
Welcome to another (maybe useful) repository of mine! This repository will contain local manifests for building custom ROMs for General Mobile 4G/5 (Seed), Wileyfox Swift (Crackling), General Mobile GM 9 Pro (GM9PRO_sprout) or Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 (Lavender). If you see one or more of those devices are missing in here, no worries, it seems like I didn't start working on them yet - You can do a pull request if you think your manifest suits here.

Check the branches for appropriate manifests.

Thanks for giving this repo a visit and caring about it!
