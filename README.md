# owZ' Manifests
Welcome to another (maybe useful) repository of mine! This repository will contain local manifests for building custom ROMs for a variety of devices. If you want to add your device here, you can do a pull request if you think your manifest suits here.

Check the branches for appropriate manifests.

Thanks for giving this repo a visit and caring about it!

# How to add these manifests into repo sync?
It's pretty easy, just clone the appropriate branch in ROM source's main folder and you're good to go!
```
git clone https://github.com/windowzytch/platform_manifest -b <branch> .repo/local_manifests
```
